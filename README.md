# DataVisualization

## Introduction 

This project is about creating a dashboard to present some statistics from The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) which is an international organisation that works to build better policies for better lives. their goal is to shape policies that foster prosperity, equality, opportunity and well-being for alla and from these data we get some information to make visualizations 


## dataset 

VAR: The original OECD code used for the cancer type
Cancer_Type: One of the five types of cancer included or all cancer types
Year: The year corresponding to the value for indicator, gender and type of cancer.
Country: Specifies whether is incidence or frequency.
COU: The original OECD code used for the indicator and gender.
Country_Status: Specifies if the country is member or partner or has an accession agreement with OECD
Measure: Specifies whether is incidence or frequency
UNIT: The original OECD code used for the indicator and gender
Value: The calculated value for the indicator taking into consideration the gender and cancer type.
